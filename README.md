# CTrees

## Description

Seeing as I'm already addicted to Quadtree's, Lets do it all again but using templates in C++!

Essentially this repository is meant to house a highly performant low level implementation of a Quad/Oct tree done using
templating in C++. Being optimized for speed the data structure is going to be quite magical and much more advanced than what one typically
expects, all in the name of being optimized on modern computers with cache performance in mind.

Fair trigger warning to anyone who is looking at this repository. This is going to be some pretty prematurely optimized stuff your looking at, 
I have a lot of free time in my reading week and I'd like to do this for fun. Not to maximize results for dev time.
